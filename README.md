# Bike Sharing Prediction with Bayesian Networks

Bike sharing services are a useful and environmentally friendly mobility solution. With their gradual introduction and growing number of users, the natural problem of resource allocation arises: how many bikes should be available in a certain period? The factors involved in this problem are usually too complex to analyse by a human, but data comes to help.  
In this work we use a Bayesian Network to get more useful insights on the usage data of a bike sharing service and demonstrate that Bayesian Networks are a powerful tool to deal with this kind of problems.
